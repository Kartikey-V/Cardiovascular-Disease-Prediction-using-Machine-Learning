# Cardiovascular-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

* Integrated the application of 5 Machine
Learning Classification Algorithms on UCI
Dataset using 10 fold cross-validation.
* Analyzed and compared each algorithm based
on Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity, ROC Curve,
and AUC.
* Visualized Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve for
comparing all algorithms.
